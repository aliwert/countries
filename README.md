# Dynamic Country Information Display
This web application fetches data about countries from a REST API and dynamically populates a select dropdown menu with the names of these countries. Upon selecting a country from the dropdown, it displays detailed information about the selected country, including its flag, capital, population, region, subregion, and languages spoken.
## Overview

By leveraging the REST Countries API, users can easily access a wide range of data about different countries, such as demographic information, geographic location, and languages spoken. The application enhances user experience by dynamically updating the displayed information based on the selected country, providing a seamless and intuitive browsing experience.
