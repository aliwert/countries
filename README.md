# Dynamic Country Information Display
This web application fetches data about countries from a REST API and dynamically populates a select dropdown menu with the names of these countries. Upon selecting a country from the dropdown, it displays detailed information about the selected country, including its flag, capital, population, region, subregion, and languages spoken.
